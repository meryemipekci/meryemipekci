### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**meryemipekci/meryemipekci** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ 
Sure! Here is a more formal version:

I initially worked as an English teacher but I had a strong desire to learn about technology. I made the decision to transition into the field of software development and specifically focused on becoming a React developer. I have been passionate about this career path ever since.

Although being a software developer can be demanding I am motivated by my genuine passion for learning. Even with the responsibilities of being a parent to two little children I am dedicated to continually expanding my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in the field.

I have a strong command of the English language allowing me to effectively communicate and collaborate with clients and teammates. Additionally I have been actively learning German (Deutsch) as I believe it is essential to have a diverse skill set in today's globalized world.

I am fully committed to my journey as a software developer continuously seeking opportunities to learn and grow in order to excel in my profession.
